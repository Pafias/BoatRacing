# BoatRacing

the code is shit

if you want to use this, i wish you good luck getting it to work properly

it does (somewhat) work though, if setup properly
#
really want to try it?

alright.

first of all you'll obviously need a racing world. make an ice racetrack on a separate world

to get the jar file compile it with the maven package thing.

you will need 2 files in the plugin directory.

copy the contents from the default **config.yml** and **game.yml** which can be found in [the resources folder](src/main/resources/) and modify it to match your racing world and lobby
(at this point i don't even know if all variables in the files are even used)

i recommend you use multiverse to manage the worlds

well, the rest you can figure out yourself
